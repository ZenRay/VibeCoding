# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Slide Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (Implicit in requirements, but specific edge cases section was optional/empty in template - I should check if I missed the Edge Cases section in my write. I did missed explicitly filling out the "Edge Cases" section placeholder. Let me check the spec again.)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Checked Edge Cases: The template had an Edge Cases section. I see I didn't explicitly fill it out in the previous `Write` call (I stopped before it or skipped it?). I need to check the file content I wrote.
