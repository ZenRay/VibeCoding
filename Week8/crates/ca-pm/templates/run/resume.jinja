# Task: Resume Interrupted Execution

## Interruption Information
- **Feature**: {{ feature.name }}
- **Interrupted At**: {{ interruption.timestamp }}
- **Last Checkpoint**: {{ interruption.checkpoint }}
- **Phase**: {{ interruption.phase }}
- **Task**: {{ interruption.task }}

## Execution State Before Interruption
### Completed Phases
{% for phase in completed_phases %}
- ✅ Phase {{ phase.number }}: {{ phase.name }}
  Duration: {{ phase.duration }}
  Cost: ${{ phase.cost }}
  Tasks: {{ phase.tasks_completed }}/{{ phase.tasks_total }}
{% endfor %}

### Completed Tasks
{% for task in completed_tasks %}
- ✅ {{ task.id }}: {{ task.description }}
  Kind: {{ task.kind }}
  Phase: {{ task.phase }}
  Files: {{ task.files | join(', ') }}
  Status: {{ task.status }}
{% endfor %}

### Files Modified So Far
{% for file in modified_files %}
- {{ file.path }}
  Status: {{ file.status }}
  Phase: {{ file.phase }}
  Size: {{ file.size }} bytes
{% endfor %}

### Current Progress
- Total Phases: {{ total_phases }}
- Completed Phases: {{ completed_phases_count }}
- Current Phase: {{ current_phase }}
- Phase Progress: {{ phase_progress }}% ({{ completed_tasks }}/{{ total_tasks }} tasks)
- Overall Progress: {{ overall_progress }}%

## Resume Context
{{ resume.context }}

## What Was Being Done
{{ resume.last_action }}

## Current State of the Codebase
{% for file in relevant_files %}
### {{ file.path }}
**Status**: {{ file.status }}
**Last Modified**: {{ file.last_modified }}

```{{ file.language }}
{{ file.content }}
```
{% endfor %}

## Next Steps
Based on the interruption point, here's what needs to be done:

### Immediate Next Task
- **Task ID**: {{ next_task.id }}
- **Kind**: {{ next_task.kind }}
- **Description**: {{ next_task.description }}
- **Files**: {{ next_task.files | join(', ') }}
- **Dependencies**: {{ next_task.dependencies | join(', ') }}
- **Priority**: {{ next_task.priority }}

### Remaining Tasks in Current Phase
{% for task in remaining_phase_tasks %}
- {{ task.id }}: {{ task.description }} ({{ task.kind }})
{% endfor %}

### Remaining Phases
{% for phase in remaining_phases %}
- Phase {{ phase.number }}: {{ phase.name }} ({{ phase.tasks_count }} tasks)
{% endfor %}

## Your Task
**Resume the execution seamlessly from where it was interrupted.**

### Resume Requirements
1. **Context Awareness**
   - Understand what was completed
   - Know what remains to be done
   - Maintain consistency with previous work

2. **Continuity**
   - Continue with the same coding style
   - Follow the same patterns
   - Maintain same quality standards

3. **State Management**
   - Update state.yml as you progress
   - Create checkpoints regularly
   - Track costs and progress

4. **Quality**
   - Maintain same or better code quality
   - Ensure compatibility with completed work
   - Follow the original plan

## Output Format
Start by acknowledging the resume:

### Resume Acknowledgment
- Confirmed interruption point
- Confirmed current state
- Confirmed next actions

Then proceed with the implementation following the same format as the original phase execution.

### Progress Updates
Provide regular updates:
- Task started: {{ task.id }}
- Task completed: {{ task.id }}
- Checkpoint created
- Moving to next task

## Guidelines
- Seamlessly continue from interruption point
- Maintain consistency with previous work
- Don't repeat completed work
- Update state regularly
- Provide clear progress indicators
- Handle any state inconsistencies gracefully
- If uncertain about state, ask for clarification
