## Code Agent Integration

This project uses **Code Agent** for AI-assisted feature development.

### Active Features

_Features managed by Code Agent will be listed here automatically_

### Completed Features

_Completed features will be archived here_

### Usage

```bash
# Plan a new feature
code-agent plan <feature-name>

# Execute feature development
code-agent run <feature-name>

# Check feature status
code-agent feature status <feature-name>

# List all features
code-agent feature list
```
